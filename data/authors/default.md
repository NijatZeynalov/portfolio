Multifaceted, AWS and Google Certified Machine Learning Engineer with 3+ years of programming experience producing machine learning solutions based on predictive modeling. Proficient with ML technologies for development, deployment of ML algorithms, entire training and inference pipelines.

Presently, I am working as a Machine Learning Engineer at azerconnect. Prior work includes Building and Deploying Face Liveness Detection Engine for Spoofing, Applying perspective transformation and homography to build OCR engine.

Previously I've worked at the Data Technologies department at the ABB as a Data Scientist where I was using predictive modeling to increase and optimize customer experiences, revenue generation (the conversion rate increased by 10 %.).

I also have an experience working as a Visiting Researcher at University of Cambridge, Computational Structural Biology Lab. I collaborated in interdisciplinary projects, recommend ML-based solutions and determine computational strategies under the professor Garib Murshudov.
