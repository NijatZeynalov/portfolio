Welcome to the course. I hope this course provides a great learning experience!

The full Machine Learning course program is a full-time program that contextualizes the skills brought in by our competitive student cohorts, who come from varied backgrounds. Incorporating traditional in-class instruction in theory and technique, students use real data to build a 15+ project portfolio to present to potential employers. 


# Program overview

Program is designed to help you learn industry-relevant data science & machine learning skills, build real-world projects, and kickstart your data science career. This program will provide you with the knowledge, skills, and experience to get a job as a Machine Learning Engineer â€“ which requires a mix of software engineering, statistical understanding, and the ability to apply both skills in new and challenging domains.

The course begins by teaching Python, which will help process data and automate tasks. From there students will learn other key concepts such as SQL & Pandas, deep learning, AWS and more.

# When and where does the course meet?

The full program runs over 32 weeks and requires 16-20 hours of work per week. The curriculum includes 3 batches, 100+ live lessons, 500+ homework assignments, and 20+ impressive real-world projects. The last week of the program is dedicated to career readiness training, which includes 1-on-1 Resume guidance, LinkedIn profile review, and mock interviews for Machine Learning roles. 

## Course modules


The first eight weeks are spent learning the theory, skills, and tools of modern data science through iterative, project-centered skill acquisition.  Admission is limited to 10 participants per batch.

# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why should I enroll in this program?

This syllabus is carefully designed which is an unique combination of theory and practice. If you want to pursue a career in data science / machine learning, this bootcamp is for you. By the end of the program:

* You will master all the skills and tools used by data science practitioners worldwide
* You will build unique real-world projects to create a strong professional portfolio
* You will follow a carefully crafted week-by-week learning roadmap
* You will be fully prepared to apply for jobs, ace interviews and get hired as a data analyst

Over 20 million new jobs in machine learning & AI will be created in just the next 5 years. There has never been a better time to make a career transition to data science.

### How the program works?

About half of that time will be spent attending classes on 2, 4 and 6th days of the week (19:00 - 21:00), and the rest will be spent working on assignments & projects during the weekend. Weekly assignments will test your skills.

The classes are taught by [Nijat Zeynalov](https://www.nijatzeynalov.com/about) who is AWS and Google Certified Machine Learning Engineer with 3+ years of programming experience producing machine learning solutions based on predictive modeling.

The program also offers a virtual classroom-like experience, recordings of the classes will be available in case you can't attend.

### What skills will I acquire by completing this program?
You will start with Python essentials, along with pandas, numpy, feature engineering for ML, ML algorithms, Deep Learning, AWS cloud services and etc. Please review the course curriculum for a list of skills you will acquire by completing the program.

### Why is the number of participants in a batch limited?
The number of participants in the batch is limited to provide personal attention and guidance to each participant of the bootcamp. Limiting the batch size allows me to make the classes more interactive, organize study groups, give detailed feedback on projects & assignments.

### What projects will I work on during the program?

You will work on the following projects during the bootcamp: Building Restaurant Recommendation System, Human Face Detection, Retail Sales Prediction Using XGBoost (Regression), Building a traffic sign classifier model, Store Sales- Time Series Forecasting and etc.

### I am new to programming. Can I still participate in the bootcamp?

Yes, syllabus was prepared for beginners. But, some basic programming knowledge will be helpful.


### How will I do payments? Do you have any discounts?

You will pay monthly. Currently:

* full program (montly)	- 310 azn for students and 350 azn for employed people.
* selected batches (monthly)	-  340 azn for students and 370 azn for employed people.

10 % discount for pre-payment.

Price might be changed when you see it, please contact with me via linkedin.

### How will assignments and projects be evaluated? Will I get any feedback?

Some assignments will be evaluated by the teacher and you will get the results within 2-3 days after submission. You will be allowed to make corrections and resubmit your assignments multiple times till you get a PASS grade.

### Will I work on projects by myself?

To simulate the experience of working in a team, some projects will be divided into several groups. All participitants in a peer group will be assigned a task on trello. You will help each other by sharing updates, discussing ideas and solving issues.
