# 2. Deep Learning

In this course, we will talk about the basics of neural networks and deep learning, how to use deep learning ConvNets, transfer learning, transformers -  a deep learning architecture that has revolutionized the traditional NLP. 

üìä In this course, you‚Äôll learn:

* Neural Network Foundations with the TensorFlow
* Using the TensorFlow to build simple, multiple, and multivariate regression models
* Convolutional Neural Networks, Transfer Learning
* Understanding origins of and theory behind distributed representations and word embeddings
* Recurrent Neural Networks
* Understanding the seq2seq architecture and Autoencoders
* Reviewing the most popular transformers, working with implementations both based on the vanilla architecture and on popular libraries: (Hugging Face and TensorFlow Hub)
* Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), discussing the various GAN architectures
* Deploying Deep Learning Model in Heroku using flask 
* Introduction to Docker, Flask, FastAPI

üìçThis course focuses on balancing important theory concepts with practical hands-on exercises and projects that let you learn how to apply the concepts in the course to your own data sets.

Students will work on state-of-the-art projects in NLP and Computer Vision tasks such as   Azerbaijani novel generation, object detection, image segmentation, and generating photo-realistic images.

Projects that you will add to your portfolio:

* Recognizing CIFAR-10 images with deep learning
* Creating custom Azerbaijani embeddings using Gensim
* Azerbaijani novel generation using Recurrent Neural Networks
* Human Face Detection
* Fake News Detection with BERT
* Text Summarizer in Azerbaijani
* Generate Human Faces with DCGAN
* Multi-Class Azerbaijani news classification
* Building Restaurant Recommendation System
* Topic Modeling with BERT

# 3. AWS Machine Learning

Specifically designed to help you prepare for the AWS Machine Learning  Specialty Certification, this learning path provides interactive content comprised of hands-on labs and lectures. 

üìä This program validates your ML skills in the cloud. In this course, you‚Äôll learn:

* Hands-on tasks designed to challenge ML intuition, creativity and knowledge of the AWS platform.
* Design and implement scalable, cost-optimized, reliable, and secure ML solutions.
* The domains of knowledge for the AWS Certified Machine Learning Speciality exam.
* Best practices for using the tools and platforms of AWS for data engineering, data analysis, machine learning modeling, model evaluation and deployment.

üìçWith this course you‚Äôll get a solid understanding of the services and platforms available on AWS for Machine Learning projects, build a foundation to pass the certification exam and feel equipped to use the AWS ML portfolio in your own real-world applications.

Students will learn about each phase of the process pipeline from instructor demonstrations and then apply that knowledge to complete a project solving various business problems. 

Projects that you will add to your portfolio:

* Analyzing Azerbaijani text on AWS with Amazon Comprehend
* Turning Speech into Text on AWS with Amazon Transcribe
* Extracting Text and Data with Amazon Textract
* Customer Churn Prediction with SageMaker Studio XGBoost Algorithm
